# Supply Chain Extraction from News Articles 

using an Large Language Model (DistilBERT), data programming and distant supervision 

This work was done as part of a project for a Statistical NLP course in 2022. 

A high-level overview can be found [here](https://ronaldbuddys.github.io/supply-chain-extract/Spotlight_Presentation.pdf)

## Database: MongoDB

requires access to a MongoDB server (local or remote). for a quick start restore from 
a database [dump](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YH6TcVo7klXb2AMOiFodi6HUfrrfWxV4/view?usp=sharing)

## Setup Virtual Environment


    # Create a virtual environment
    python3 -m venv venv
    
    # Activate the virtual environment
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # Installing dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt


## News Articles: Common Crawl

#### Available Compressed News Articles â€” Updated Daily 
get list of warc (compressed file) of news articles
`aws s3 ls --recursive s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-NEWS/`

requires `AWS Command Line Interface` and access credentials. See: [AWS CLI User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)

given above, update available warc files

`python -m supply_chain_extract.common_crawl_warc_files`


#### Download Warc Files, Extract News Articles

`python -m supply_chain_extract.news_please`

#### Add Articles with Company Names Found in Knowledge Base

`python -m supply_chain_extract.add_articles_to_mongodb`


## Run Apps for Reviewing Content

#### Long to Short (Common) Name Mapping

Reuters articles may use more than one name to refer to a company,
a so called 'Long' name and one or more short names e.g. 'International Business Machines Corp' -> IBM

Company's a first identified by their Long name, using the Knowledge Base. 
Use the following dashboard to identify the short names


`python -m app.view_articles`

#### Golden Labelling

Review sentences containing entity pairs to create gold labels, to be used
in classification fine-tuning 

`python -m app.view_sentences`

### Distant Supervision (noisy label generation)

Distant supervision is a technique for automatically generating labels for training data for relation extraction tasks. 
It's assumption is if two entities are known to have a certain relation, any text mentioning these entities might express that relation. 
This allows for leveraging an existing knowledge base to annotate large text corpora automatically.
However, this method can introduce noise to labels as not all mentions of entity pairs necessarily reflect the intended relation. 

For more details see: [Distant supervision for relation extraction without labeled data](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/mintz.pdf)

### Data Programming (noisy label generation)

Data Programming allows for the creation of large training datasets by using weak supervision provided by labeling functions,
reducing the need to rely on manually annotated data. Labeling functions, which are heuristics or rules designed by domain experts, 
automatically annotate data with probable labels. The approach aggregates these noisy, conflicting annotations to generate a probabilistically labeled dataset. 

For more details see: [Data Programming:
Creating Large Training Sets, Quickly](https://dawn.cs.stanford.edu/pubs/snorkel-nips2016.pdf), as well as the 
as the Python package used for creating labelling functions: [snorkel](https://www.snorkel.org/)
