Corning	Apple		" (GLW.N) on Tuesday reported a drop in sales at its screen glass unit for the first time in at least four quarters, and said it expects the weakness to spill into the current quarter, adding to growing market jitters about demand for high-end smartphones.
Shares of the specialty glass maker, whose Gorilla glass became the screen of choice for many smartphones including "	's (AAPL.O) iPhone and Samsung's (005930.KS) Galaxy, were down about 3 percent in morning trade.	620d716fc02377e1232d8f11

At least two other "	" suppliers - contract chipmaker Taiwan (2330.TW) and chipmaker AMS (AMS.S) - have pointed to soft demand from smartphone customers in the past week. Analysts have attributed the softness to weaker-than-anticipated demand for the California company's iPhone X.
Global sales of smartphones to end users was nearly 408 million units in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 5.6 percent year-over-year decline for the first time ever, Gartner Research said in February.
"	" said net sales in its specialty materials business fell 7 percent to $278 million in the first quarter, missing analysts' estimates of $293 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company expects a similar year-over-year decline in the unit in the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer R. Tony Tripeny said in a post-earnings conference call."	620d716fc02377e1232d8f11

Exxon Mobil	Abu Dhabi National	"(Reuters) - Hess Corp (HES.N) reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Wednesday, as lower prices for its natural gas and natural gas liquids more than offset higher output from its Bakken shale assets in North Dakota.

Shares fell 7% to $57.73 in afternoon trading.
Natural gas prices have hovered near two-decade lows as a long and steady increase in U.S. production due to the shale oil boom has led to ample supplies.
Hess said average selling prices for natural gas fell 27.8% and natural gas liquids slumped 34.5% in the fourth quarter.
The extended weak prices have forced Chevron (CVX.N), Range Resources (RRC.N) and EQT Corp (EQT.N) to warn of impairments on their gas-producing assets.
Hess said it expects to spend $3 billion in 2020, compared with $2.74 billion last year, as it bets big on Bakken and offshore Guyana, which has emerged as one of the most important oil and gas discoveries of the last decade.
The company is part of a consortium led by oil major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and has forecast total recoverable oil and gas resources of more than 8 billion barrels in offshore Guyana.
The higher budget comes as the U.S. shale industry has reined in spending under pressure to produce higher shareholder returns.
“Investors are worried that the losses that they incur in 2020 might be as big, if not bigger, than 2019,” said Bill Selesky, a senior analyst at Argus Research, adding they are also concerned about Hess' higher spending in 2020.
Hess expects net production in Guyana to average about 25,000 barrels of oil per day for 2020, while it estimates net production in Bakken to average about 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d).
The two areas will become significant cash generators over the next several years, Chief Executive Officer John Hess said on a post-earnings call with analysts.
Hess said production from Bakken rose 38% to 174,000 boe/d pushing up total production, excluding Libya, by 18.4% to 316,000 boe/d in the quarter.
Analysts had expected net production of 309,814 boe/d.
Excluding items, Hess reported a loss of 60 cents per share, bigger than estimates of 52 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."			620fa740da65adfed100fa6d

Exxon Mobil	Oil Search	MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Plans to double gas exports from Papua New Guinea within the next four years are in doubt after the government walked away from talks with 	" on a key gas project needed for the $13 billion expansion.
Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape on Friday called off negotiations with Exxon on the P'nyang field, blaming the energy giant for failing to budge on a proposed deal that was “out of the money”.
The expansion of liquefied natural gas exports is crucial for the impoverished Pacific nation, but is vying with several proposed LNG projects in Australia, Mozambique, Qatar, Russia and the United States.
One of Exxon's partners in the PNG project, "	, said on Monday the terms the government had sought would have made the project unprofitable.	620fa741da65adfed100fa7e

Average realised"	"s prices for 2019 were 5% lower than 2018, Oil Search said. Global LNG prices came under pressure last year due to an oversupply as several large scale projects came online.
Meanwhile, Oil Search said talks between the Papua New Guinea government and Exxon Mobil are continuing over the planned development of the P'nyang gas field.

The plan underscores the South Korean firm's ambition to challenge bigger rivals - "	"'s TSMC in contract chip manufacturing and San Diego-based Qualcomm in mobile processing chips - as the memory chip market contracts sharply after years of an unprecedented boom.
Global semiconductor makers are in a race to produce powerful chips to support new technologies such as fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks, connected cars and artificial intelligence (AI).
In March, U.S. chip supplier Nvidia Corp agreed to buy Israeli chip designer Mellanox for $6.8 billion, beating rival Intel in a deal that would help Nvidia boost its data center and AI businesses.
"	, which has expanded its chip business largely through organic investment, said on Wednesday its 133 trillion won ($116 billion) spending will comprise of 73 trillion won for domestic R&D and 60 trillion won for production infrastructure.	62110042c922be9cc1159914

During opening statements in one of the most closely watched U.S. antitrust trials in years, Justice Department lawyer Craig Conrath said the deal would hike prices for consumers by more than $400 million annually, or an average of $0.45 a month for pay TV subscribers.
"	 lawyer Daniel Petrocelli, in his opening statement, ridiculed the Justice Department's case and suggested the administration was “fundamentally stuck in the past” and that its arguments were “divorced from reality.”	6211004bc922be9cc115999f

Conrath suggested that "	" would be able to hike fees that Turner charges for its content by about 10 percent if the merger were approved and that the company could withhold content from rival distributors. He referenced an internal email from Turner executives that Dish Network Corp's Sling service would be “crap” without Turner content, as he paraphrased the stronger language in the email.

The exit comes against the backdrop of rising tensions between the two companies after Tyson Chief Executive Officer Noel White said in February that the company would develop its o"	"ant-based protein products, Axios reported here earlier on Wednesday, citing multiple sources.
Tyson's stake was noticeably absent in Beyond Meat's amended initial public offering filing on the list of stakeholders who own more than 5 percent.
Beyond Meat filed on Monday to raise up to $183.8 million in an IPO, seeking a valuation of up to $1.21 billion.
Based on that valuation, Tyson's stake would have been worth about $79 million. It was not immediately clear how much Tyson sold its stake for, while the Axios report said there must have been multiple buyers.
“Tyson Ventures is pleased with the investment in Beyond Meat and has decided the time is right to exit ... (Tyson) plans to launch an alternative protein product soon with market testing anticipated this summer,” Tyson spokesman Worth Sparkman told Reuters.
Beyond Meat did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Beyond Meat, which sells its plant-based burger at Carl's Jr., no longer wanted the Tyson Ventures representative in its board meetings, partly over fears that the company might try to interfere with potential mergers and acquisitions, according to the Axios report.
Tyson's shares fell 1.6 percent in afternoon trading.
Retailer Walmart said earlier in the day it would create its own an end-to-end supply chain of Angus beef, potentially competing with Tyson."		6211004dc922be9cc11599bd

Chevron	Exxon Mobil	The agency plans to hold a public hearing on the propose	"on March 29.
The credit reforms plan faces stiff opposition from oil majors such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron. These companies generate more credits than they need to comply with the law, allowing to profit by selling the credits when their prices rise.
Under the U.S. Renewable Fuels Standard, oil refiners are required to blend increasing volumes of biofuels like ethanol into their diesel and gasoline each year, or purchase the credits, called RINs, from those that do.
Reuters last week reported the details of the planned rule.
On Tuesday, EPA said its proposal aimed to prohibit certain parties from buying separated RINs or to require public disclosure when RIN holdings exceed specified thresholds. It would also limit the length of time a non-obligated party can hold RINs, and increase the compliance frequency of the program from annually to quarterly.
Non-obligated parties are largely seen as banks and financial institutions that are not part of the fuel supply chain. Such market participants in the past have acquired large volumes of the biofuel credits in speculative plays. This forces smaller players that require credits to scramble to buy them, often at higher prices, so they can comply with the biofuels law.
The oil majors are expected to align themselves with truck stop operators and other fuel retailers who are routine sellers of the credits, setting the stage for the next clash over the nation's biofuels laws."		62110074c922be9cc1159ba2

PetroChina	China	"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed on Friday as the S&P hit an intraday record for the fourth time this week after an upbeat U.S. jobs report and data on Chinese manufacturing lessened concerns about slowing global growth.

Job growth slowed less than forecast in October, as a drag from a strike at General Motors (GM.N) was made up for in other areas of the labor market, while job gains in the prior two months were stronger than previously thought.
“It's really good. The market should like it because obviously with the GM strike, manufacturing being affected by that, it is a very nice report and one people should be pretty excited about overall,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.
The strong jobs number helped overshadow a report that showed the manufacturing sector contracted for a third straight month.
Along with the S&P's new high, the Nasdaq topped its July intraday record after both indexes closed out October with their best monthly performance since June as quarterly earnings have come in stronger than anticipated and U.S.-China trade rhetoric has appeared productive.
Prior to the jobs report, sentiment was supported by data showing China manufacturing activity unexpectedly expanded in October, easing concerns about a slowdown in demand from the world's second-largest economy as a result of U.S. tariffs.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 250.48 points, or 0.93%, to 27,296.71, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 24.68 points, or 0.81%, to 3,062.24 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 73.29 points, or 0.88%, to 8,365.65.
U.S.-China trade news remained supportive for stocks, as Beijing's state-media Xinhua News Agency reported the two countries have “reached consensus on principles.” Earlier, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the “phase one” trade pact with China appeared in good shape.
About 76% of the 356 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have beaten profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
However, profit growth forecasts for the next four quarters have been revised lower, even as expectations for a decline in third-quarter earnings have shrunk to 0.8% from 2.2% at the start of October.
Oil major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) rose 2.70% after it beat recently lowered third-quarter profit expectations. The energy sector .SPNY gained 2.29% as the best-performing S&P sector, and oil prices jumped on trade deal progress.

But Pinterest Inc (PINS.N) plunged 16.39% after the online scrapbook company missed quarterly revenue estimates.
Arista (ANET.N) slumped 24.80% after the cloud infrastructure supplier forecast current-quarter revenue much below Wall Street expectations.

“I assume that we have checked it correctly so far and I also assume that the firms submitted their applications correctly and stand by what they submitted,” Mitterlehner told reporters.
EADS had competed with Sweden's Saab and U.S.-based Lockheed Martin to win the contract.
Austria's defence minister has said Austria might try to cancel the deal, or seek damages and a refund, if it found bribes were paid, as it is entitled to do under a clause in the contract.
The 2003 contract called for the offset deals to be completed by 2018. The value of the deals was negotiated down from an original 4 billion euros to around 3.5 billion as the contract was cut to 15 jets from 18.
Of that total, 3.3 billion had been had been recognised by the end of 2010.

Atlas V's dual Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10A-4-2 engines are poised to shoot Starliner on a 113-mile (98 nautical miles/181 km) suborbita"	"ectory before the capsule separates and flies under its own power to the space station in a roughly 24-hour overall journey.
The Starliner capsule headlined Boeing's efforts against billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX to be the first to return NASA astronauts to the space station from U.S. soil in nearly a decade.
But a series of software glitches during the December 2019 debut launch resulted in its failure to dock at the orbital laboratory outpost. SpaceX's Crew Dragon has gone on to launch three crewed space station missions since 2020, with a fourth slated as early as Oct. 31, according to NASA.
Boeing has spent a year and a half correcting issues flagged during NASA reviews, part of the U.S. space agency's strategy to ensure access to the sprawling international research satellite some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.
NASA in 2014 awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to build their own capsules that could fly American astronauts to the space station in an effort to wean the United States off its dependence on Russia's Soyuz vehicles for rides to space following the end of NASA's space shuttle program in 2011.
If all goes well, Boeing will bring the capsule home on Aug. 9, and then attempt the follow-on crewed mission that the company has said will take place no earlier than December.

(Reuters) - Japan on Friday said it had picked Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 7011.T (MHI) to lead the development of a new stealth fighter jet that Japan wants operational by the mid-2030s to counter advanced Chinese aircraft.
“We awarded the prime contract to Mitsubishi Heavy,” a ministry of defence spokesman said.
The fighter jet project, which is expected to cost about $40 billion, comes at an opportune time for MHI, as the company is pulling back from plans to build its SpaceJet regional passenger aircraft as coronavirus travel curbs leave airlines with little cash to buy new planes.
The decision was expected because MHI is Japan's only jet fighter manufacturer, and no other company bid for the contract. Other suppliers and partners will most likely be identified by the end of the year.
U.S. firms that have expressed interest in joining the project include F-35 stealth fighter maker Lockheed Martin LMT.N, F-18 Super Hornet builder Boeing BA.N and Northrop Grumman NOC.N from the United States. British companies include BAE Systems Plc BAES.L and jet engine maker Rolls Royce Holdings Plc RR.L.
In its budget request for the year starting in April, Japan's defence ministry has asked for about $730 million to fund research and development of the proposed fighter jet, referred to as the F-X or F-3.
Japan's air force flies about 200 Boeing F-15 jets and is replacing squadrons of decades-old F-4 fighters with F-35s. The new plane will succeed the F-2, a derivative of the F-16 Fighting Falcon jointly developed by MHI and Lockheed Martin more than two decades ago."			62126075e4bd45f7f521e49f

Barclays expects LG's revenue from panel supplies to Apple and Amazon to jump nearly 70 percent to 2.1 trillion won worth in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, due to solid demand for the iPhone 5, iPad mini and "	"'s Kindle tablet computer.
LG's new and thinner display -- its in-cell touch screen panel, which is used in the iPhone 5 -- costs 40 percent more than that of conventional smartphone panels, according to Nomura Securities. Analysts at Korea Investment & Securities expect panel sales to Apple to rise to around 27 percent of LG's total revenue in the second half of this year from 16 percent in the first half.

Tesla	Toyota	"DETROIT (Reuters) - While U.S. new-vehicle sales in June are expected to decline as much as 30%, research firms on Thursday maintained that retail demand has held up relatively well during the coronavirus outbreak and the question now is whether the industry can rebuild inventories fast enough as demand rebounds.

“The fact that retail sales - not fleet - are what kept the market propped up speaks volumes to the resilience of the American consumer,” Edmunds' executive director of insights Jessica Caldwell said in a statement.
The shutdown of plants and auto dealers hit the U.S. auto sector hard in April and May, but assembly plants reopened starting May 18 and have since boosted production while sales have rebounded as states reopen economies.
TrueCar subsidiary ALG expects sales of new cars and trucks to drop 24%, with the month finishing with a annual sales rate of 13 million units, down from 17.2 million last year. Excluding fleet sales, retail deliveries will decline 15%, but rise 1.5% from May.
With inventories lower, availability of some vehicles, especially pickup trucks made by General(GM.N), Ford(F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV(FCHA.MI)(FCAU.N), could suffer, analysts said.
Tesla's (TSLA.O) build-to-order model means the electric carmaker will see a big decline in June sales, analysts said.
Edmunds expects June sales to drop 29% from last year but only 3.6% from May. It expects an annual sales rate of 12.8 million vehicles.
As inventories dwindle and automakers pull back on incentives, the industry needs to prepare for uncertainties ahead, Caldwell said.

MELBOURNE, July 2 (Reuters) - Chevron (CVX.N) and its partners in the Gorgon LNG project off Western Australia have agreed to go ahead with a $4 billion project to improve gas recovery from offshore wells and keep the huge liquefied natural gas plant filled for 40 years.
The Jansz-Io Compression (J-IC) project, which will help gas recovery at the Gorgon LNG project as the Jansz-Io field ages, is expected to take five years to complete, the U.S. oil major said.
The decision comes as Australia's LNG exporters tout their role in helping Asian customers switch from using dirtier coal in power generation, while the Australian government faces international pressure to do more to curb carbon emissions.

The J-IC project involves building a 27,000-tonne floating field control station, a subsea compression infrastructure and a 135-kilometre (84-mile) underwater power cable to Barrow Island, where the 15.6 million tonnes a year LNG plant is.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing learned that a cockpit warning light on its 737 MAX jetliner was defective in 2017 but decided to defer fixing it until 2020, U.S. lawmakers said on Friday.
The defective warning light alerts pilots when two sensors that measure the angle between the airflow and the wing disagree. Faulty “angle of attack” data is suspected of playing a role in two deadly crashes involving Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX in Indonesia in October and in Ethiopia in March.
Those crashes, which killed 346 people, have triggered investigations by aviation regulators and U.S. lawmakers and left Chicago-based Boeing facing one of the biggest crises in its more than 100-year history.
Boeing decided in November 2017 to defer a software update to correct the so-called AOA Disagree alert defect until 2020, three years after discovering the flaw, U.S. Congressmen Peter DeFazio and Rick Larsen said in a press release on Friday. Boeing only accelerated this schedule after the Lion Air accident in Indonesia, they added.
Boeing spokesman Gordon Johndroe said by email that a company safety review found the absence of the AOA Disagree alert did not adversely impact airplane safety or operation.
“Based on the safety review, the update was scheduled for the MAX 10 entry into service in 2020,” Johndroe said. “We fell short in the implementation of the AoA Disagree alert and are taking steps to address these issues so they do not occur again.”
Boeing has said it discovered the problem in 2017, soon after it began delivering its top-selling 737 MAX aircraft to customers. But it did not inform the U.S. Federal (FAA) about the defect until after the Lion Air crash more than one year later, the lawmakers said.
The House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure sent letters to Boeing, supplier United Technologies Corp and the FAA requesting further details on the AoA Disagree alert, the lawmakers said.
The letter was the second such records request sent by the committee to Boeing and the FAA related to its investigation into the MAX aircraft."			621260fee4bd45f7f521eb28

Boeing	Spirit	"(Reuters) - Boeing is expected to continue burning cash despite pausing production of its 737 MAX jet, as it will leave its workforce intact and likely provide support to suppliers, analysts said.

Some estimated the cash burn at around $1 billion a month.
The airline said on Monday it would suspend production in January, its biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years, as repercussions from two deadly crashes of the now-grounded aircraft drag into 2020.
Boeing, which builds the 737 south of Seattle, said it would not lay off any of the roughly 12,000 employees there during the production freeze.
“We estimate that Boeing is burning nearly $2 billion per month on the MAX but this will not drop to zero during the halt,” JPMorgan analysts said in a note to clients.
They assumed more than half of those costs will remain due to internal overhead and staff expenses as well as support for key suppliers like fuselage producer Spirit.
Analysts at Jefferies estimated a cash burn of more than $730 million a month.
The U.S. Federal needs to certify software changes and training plans before the plane can resume flying in the United States. Other regulators then need to sign off for it to return in other parts of the world.
The duration of the production halt is uncertain, making it hard to forecast the financial impact on Boeing and its suppliers.
“We don't know what Boeing plans to do about its suppliers,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group.
“They might need them to stop component, systems, and structures deliveries, but it would still need to help these suppliers keep workers and capacity so they can go back to full output when the time comes.”
Jefferies estimated the halt could last three months, which would reduce its 2020 737 MAX delivery forecast to 462 planes from 807.
It would take until the second half of 2022 for Boeing to be fully clear of inventory, given it has produced 400 of the jets since the March grounding that have yet to be delivered to customers, Jefferies said.
“Given the grounding has stretched longer than expected, we believe we could see the payments/concession increase from initial levels,” it said of compensation to airlines, for which Boeing announced a $5.6 billion pre-tax charge in July.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada launched a long-delayed competition to build new fighter jets on Tuesday, and said it was confident no favoritism had been shown toward any one contender, though some in the industry have said the race is tilted towards Lockheed Martin..
Ottawa wants 88 new planes in a contract worth between C$15 billion ($11.4 billion) and C$19 billion ($14.5 billion). Initial proposals are due in the spring of 2020, with a winner named early in 2022, and the first aircraft delivery to be scheduled for as early as 2025, a statement from the federal government said.
Earlier this month, sources told Reuters that Airbus and Boeing might pull out over fears the air force is determined to buy Lockheed Martin's F-35 plane. A fourth contender is Sweden's Saab.
There was no immediate comment from any of the four potential bidders.
Andre Fillion, assistant deputy minister of Defense and Marine Procurement, said there had been “intense engagement” with all the eligible suppliers while drafting the jet requirements, and “thousands of changes” were made as a consequence.
“We're quite confident that we have a product that we'll publish today that does not have any show stoppers for any of the suppliers,” Fillion said in a telephone interview."			6213d62e6f53f60ce7d7c9b2

A Samsung spokesman declined to comment.
Samsung initially announced a recall of some 2.5 million Note 7 phones in September and identified the cause of the fire as a manufacturing process problem at one of its suppliers, later identified as affiliate Samsung SDI (006400.KS).

""To me it'd be surprising if they said it was a supplier issue,"" IDC's Ma said, adding he suspects Samsung may not have given enough room for the battery inside the phone.
The company in October said it will examine all aspects of the phone, including hardware design and software, and would hire third-party firms as part of its probe.
The source told Reuters on Monday that Samsung was able to replicate the fires during its investigation and that the cause for the fires could not be explained by hardware design or software-related matters.

The latest investment is another sign that Hyundai has abandoned its strategy of developing technolog"	" a strategy which previously raised investor concerns that it may be left behind in the race for future mobility.
Hyundai, along with affiliate Kia Motors (000270.KS) ranks fifth in global sales, have joined rivals in making a series of investments in technology firms, including self-driving car tech startup Aurora, especially after heir apparent Euisun Chung was promoted a year ago.
Hyundai Motor said in February that it will invest 14.7 trillion won ($12.3 billion) in future technologies such as self-driving, connectivity and car sharing areas by 2023.
In March Hyundai and Kia Motors Corp announced a plan to invest $300 million in Indian ride-hailing platform Ola, following the the $275 million that the pair invested in Singapore-based ride-hailing firm Grab last year.
In November, Hyundai invested $250 million in Singapore's ride-hailing firm Grab, raising its stakes in growing Southeast Asian markets.
The Aptiv venture will be headquartered in Boston, with technology centers across the United States and Asia, including South Korea.
The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close early in the second quarter of 2020.

(Reuters) - Sprint Nextel Corp Chief Executive Dan Hesse said he plans to kick off a high-speed wireless service in five U.S. cities on July 15, a move that could be crucial in its efforts to compete with bigger rivals Verizon Wireless and AT&T.
Sprint, the No. 3 U.S. mobile service, is upgrading its network with the same Long Term Evolution (LTE) high-speed technology its rivals are adopting, but is about a year-and-a-half behind Verizon Wireless and about 10 months behind AT&T.
Hesse said on Wednesday the service will start in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City and San Antonio, and that more market launches will be announced later in the year.
Sprint also said that by the end of 2013, it expects to have largely completed the build-out of its high-speed LTE nationwide network across the United States.
Hesse told reporters in Atlanta that savings from reduced customer service costs have helped fund the network investment. He said customer care costs at Sprint have fallen to $2 billion from almost $4 billion about four years ago.
“Good customer service costs less,” Hesse said.
The service, which is expected to provide money-losing Sprint a roughly six-fold increase in data speeds, is part of a $7 billion project that includes upgrading one network and decommissioning another.
Sprint has also committed to buying $15.5 billion of iPhones from Apple in the next few years.
Sprint has said it would launch LTE around mid-year, listing Atlanta, Baltimore, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City and San Antonio as the first cities to have its LTE service.
Sprint already sells multiple phones that support LTE in the hopes that customers would buy the devices in advance of the service launch.
One of those smartphones is the new Samsung Galaxy S III, which is seeing rampant demand. Hesse said supply shortages of that phone had delayed its availability in stores.
Sprint also said on Wednesday the Samsung Galaxy S III will be available in stores as of July 1. A 16GB version will be priced at $199.99 and 32GB version for $249.99 with a new line or eligible upgrade and two-year service agreement.
Sprint's shares have been hugely volatile since the company gave details of its upgrade plans in October last year. The stock closed unchanged at $3.13 on Wednesday.
